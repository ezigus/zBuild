## Documentation Expertise

For documentation-focused issues, apply a lightweight approach:

### Scope
- Focus on accuracy over comprehensiveness
- Update only what's actually changed or incorrect
- Remove outdated information rather than marking it deprecated
- Keep examples current and runnable

### Writing Style
- Use active voice and present tense
- Lead with the most important information
- Use code examples for anything technical
- Keep paragraphs short — 2-3 sentences max

### Structure
- Start with a one-line summary of what this documents
- Include prerequisites and setup if applicable
- Provide a quick start / most common usage first
- Put advanced topics and edge cases later

### Skip Heavy Stages
This is a documentation change. The following pipeline stages can be simplified:
- **Design stage**: Skip — documentation doesn't need architecture design
- **Build stage**: Focus on file edits only, no compilation needed
- **Test stage**: Verify links work and examples are syntactically correct
- **Review stage**: Focus on accuracy and clarity, not code patterns

### Required Output (Mandatory)

Your output MUST include these sections when this skill is active:

1. **What to Document**: List of documentation files created/modified with specific sections added to each
2. **What to Skip**: Explicitly state which topics are NOT documented and why (e.g., "Advanced topic X is out of scope for this issue")
3. **Audience**: Who will read this documentation (developers, users, operators) and what level of detail is appropriate

If any section is not applicable, explicitly state why it's skipped.
