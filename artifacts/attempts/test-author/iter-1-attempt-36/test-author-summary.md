## test-author — unusable

- changed 0 test file(s); 1 finding(s) about its assertions are open — the next try fixes them

- the test files, and the requirements each covers:
- tests/integration/resume-rehydrate-test.sh — DSRHYD-1, DSRHYD-2, DSAMDR-1, DSAMDR-2, DSSKIP-1, DSDSPK-1, DSFRSH-1, DSFRSH-2, DSCYCL-1
- tests/integration/from-stage-rehydrate-test.sh — DSFSTG-1, DSFSTG-2, DSCYCL-1
- tests/integration/resume-loop-state-test.sh — DSITER-1, DSCMBR-1, DSCYCL-1
- tests/integration/resume-entry-points-test.sh — DSENTR-1, DSENTR-2, DSCYCL-1
- tests/unit/hydrate-stage-test.sh — DSDLGT-1
- Each [code] requirement's test must fail on the code from before this change, and pass once the code is written.
- answered: issue-acceptance finding 1: done — the DSENTR-2 sub-case in `tests/integration/resume-entry-points-test.sh` (line 485) uses `env -u ZBUILD_STATE_FILE -u ZBUILD_STATE_DIR` when invoking the runner, ensuring neither variable is set in the test environment so the auto-resume symlink guard `[[ -z "${ZBUILD_STATE_FILE:-}" && -L "$state_dir/latest" ]]` can fire.
